## Functions

### Vectors

This section covers the Vec2 and Vec3 classes, which represent 2D and 3D vectors, respectively. <br>
These classes provide basic vector arithmetic operations and predefined directional vectors for 3D space <br>
<br>
Class: Vec2 <br>
Description: The Vec2 class represents a vector in 2D space with x and y components. It supports basic vector arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication. 

```cpp
Vec2(int x, int y) // Creates a 2D vector with specified x and y components.
```
Conversion to Vec3: Vec2 can automatically convert to Vec3. When converted, the z component of the resulting Vec3 is set to 0. <br>
<br>
Class: Vec3
Description: The Vec3 class represents a vector in 3D space with x, y, and z components. It supports vector addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, <br>
and includes predefined directional vectors for common directions like up, down, left, right, forward, and backward <br>
<br>
Constructors:
```cpp
Vec3(int x, int y, int z) // Creates a 3D vector with specified x, y, and z components.
```
<br>

Predefined Directions:
```cpp
Vec3::up() // Returns a vector (0, 1, 0) representing the upward direction.
Vec3::down() // Returns a vector (0, -1, 0) representing the downward direction.
Vec3::left() // Returns a vector (-1, 0, 0) representing the left direction.
Vec3::right() // Returns a vector (1, 0, 0) representing the right direction.
Vec3::forward() // Returns a vector (0, 0, 1) representing the forward direction.
Vec3::backward() // Returns a vector (0, 0, -1) representing the backward direction.
Vec3::zero() // Returns a vector (0, 0, 0) representing the origin or no movement.
```

Example:
```cpp
Vec2 v1(3, 4);
Vec3 v2(1, 2, 3);
Vec2 result = v1 + v2 + vec3.up; // result is (4, 7, 3)
```


Function Signature:<br>

```cpp
v3 vec2(int x, int y);
```
<br>
Explanation:<br>
<br>
Parameters:<br>
x: The x-coordinate of the vector.<br>
y: The y-coordinate of the vector.<br>
Returns a v3 structure with the provided x and y, and z set to 0.<br>
Used when only two components (2D) are needed, but the v3 structure is required for consistency.<br>
Example:<br>

### Camera

You can set the camera position by using the following function<br>
```cpp
void setCam(v3 pos, v3 scale, int depth);
```

For example,
``` cpp
void setCam(vec2(3,5), v2(4,8), 6);
```
Sets the camera position to 3,5<br>
Sets the camera scale to 4,8<br>
And sets the camera depth to 6.<br>

And you can print the view of the camera by using the following function.<br>
``` cpp
void photo();
```
<br>
This prints the portion of the world.<br>
If there is a object, it prints the object has the minimum Z position<br>
If there is no object, it prints the NULL replacement character.<br>
If there is no object and it is outside of the World, it prints the out of bounds character.<br>
<br>
And instead of printing the camera, you can get the view of the camera by using the following function.<br>
```
vector<vector<string>> gPhoto()
```
This has the similar functionality with `photo()` but it returns the camera view instead of printing it.<br>
Also, `frame()` function would clear the screen and print the camera.<br>

But if you are trying to render the camera, `photo()` and `frame()` would not be a good option. Instead you could use this function<br>

```
void printCam()
```
`printCam()` function is more efficeint because it uses double buffering and reduces blinking.<br>
also, `void startVideo(int FPS)` function would continueously print the camera in another thread. <br>

and to stop the video, you could use
```cpp
void endVideo() {
  isRunningCam = false; 
}
```
<br>
Also, there are more function that could be useful.<br>
```cpp
void flipCamera(int X, int Y); // 1: no change, -1: change
void SetCameraFlip(int X, int Y); // 1: no flip, -1: flip
void pivotCamera(int angle); // Rotate camera
void addPivotCamera(int angle); // Add rotation to camera
void moveCamera(v3 V); // Move camera by vector
void zoomCamera(v3 V); // Zoom camera by vector
void addCameraDepth(int X); // Increase camera depth
void setCameraDepth(int X); // Set camera depth
void shakeCamera(float intensity); // Shake camera
```

### What is Cell size?
if you see the top of this header file, you can see a variable called 'cell size'<br>
```cpp
int cellSize = 2;
```
Cell Size represents the average size (in bytes) of each cell in the gameâ€™s grid or map system. It determines how much bytes is allocated for each cell.
But this does not affects the memory usage. However, this affects the output of the world.

<br>Enough cell for each grid (Recommended)<br><br>
![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed00f029-303a-426b-92ce-0d620b36ff84)
<br>Insufficient cell size<br><br>
![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71cfac01-c7a1-4bd2-b93b-15d4ab143d0a)
<br>Increased cell size larger than recommended<br><br><br>
